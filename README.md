# Surprise Greeting Cards

![Demo](/gh-assets/demo.gif)

Surprise Greeting Cards is a website I create to allow me to send cards to my friends for all different occasions. This site can be forked for you're own use.

Right now it uses Auth0 for authentication to protect the dashboard route and firestore as a backend.

This app allows the ability to create two cards:
- Image cards
- Text Cards

This allows the front cover to be an image or custom text. The card is then stored with a shortId and can be publicly distributed.
